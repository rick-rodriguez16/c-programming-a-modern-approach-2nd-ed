# Standardization

C evolved during the 1970s. During this time The C Programming Language book (K&R book) came out. Cs popularity with developers continued to grow. By the 1980s, C had grown beyond its narrow scope of UNIX.  Compilers became available for C to serve on various machines and operating systems, particulary the IBM PC.

Problems began to arise as more developers continued to create using C. K&R's book for example, was fuzzy on some language features. So compilers began to treat these features differently. Also, there was a gray area between features that were C specific and features that were UNIX specific. This would threaten C's portability.

A standard was developed and put into place starting in 1983 under ANSI. The standard was completed in 1988 and formally approved one year later. This ultimately became C89/C90. In 1995, more changes occurred. A new standard arose that would become C99. 

C99, at the time of the books writing, was not yet universal. So billions of lines of code are not (and may never become) C99 compliant. The books Appendix B lists the major changes between C89 and C99.
