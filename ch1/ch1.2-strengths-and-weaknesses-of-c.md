# Philosophy of C

## C is a low-level language
C provides access to machine-level concepts, such as bytes and addresses. C provides operations that correspond closely to a computer's built-in instructions. This allows application programs that lean on input/output, storage management, and other services to run fast. An operating system cannot afford to be slow.

## C is a small language
The C language has a limited set a features to keep it small. It therefore relies heavily on a "library" of standard functions.

## C is a permissive language
C assumes that the developer knows that they are doing. The C language does not mandate detailed error-checking.

## Strengths
- C is efficient.
- C is portable.
- C is powerful.
- C is flexible.
- C gets its strength from its standard library.
- C can easily integrate with UNIX.

## Weaknesses
- C can be error-prone.
- C is terse.
- C programs can be difficult to understand.
- C programs can be dificult to modify.

## Effective Use of C
- Learn how to avoid pitfalls and traps in C. The compiler will catch most of these, but not all of them.
- Use software tools to make programs more reliable. C developers are constantly creating tools.
- Learn and use the existing code libraries. Libraries are tools that you can use to create your own programs.
- Adopt a sensible set of coding conventions. Make a habit of using proper coding conventions when working with C.
- Avoid clever C code and other tricks when possible. Keep C code simple. Strike a balance between conciseness and readability for easier maintenance in the future.
- Stick to the standard C features and library functions. Avoid nonstandard features until it is absolutely needed.
